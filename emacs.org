** Processes ([[info:elisp#Processes][info:elisp#Processes]])
*** Three ways to start a process
**** =start-process= async process returns process object
**** =call-process= synchronous process - no object
**** =call-process-region= synchronous process - no object
**** Common arguments:
***** PROGRAM - name of the file
***** ARGS - arguments to be provided
****** ~, ., .. all work
****** $HOME etc does not work
***** BUFFER-OR-NAME - location for standard output to go
****** nil to discard output
**** Shell constructs do not work - not using a shell
**** Use =shell-quote-argument= e.g.:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(concat "diff -c "
	(shell-quote-argument oldfile)
	" "
	(shell-quote-argument newfile))
#+END_SRC
